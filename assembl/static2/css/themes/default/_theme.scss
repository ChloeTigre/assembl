/*
  ASSEMBL DEFAULT THEME
  If you want to create a new theme, it is recommended that your theme SCSS file uses `@import` of this default theme file
  (for example, `@import "../../../default/_theme.scss";`), so if a default theme variable is not overriden in your theme
  (for example a variable which would have been added in Assembl code after the creation of your theme),
  the SCSS will still compile, and the variable will have the default value.
*/

// $theme-local-cyan: #0af;
// $theme-local-blue-light: #dbdeef;
$theme-local-blue-opacity: rgba(25, 40, 130, 0.6); // Only use for Bright Mirror
// $theme-local-blue-opacity-min: rgba(25, 40, 130, 0.1);

/*
  Global theme variables
  You can redefine here any of the default theme variables. Theme variables are used in the entire SCSS infrastructure.
  Theme variables which are not redefined by a theme will keep their default value,
  which is defined in css/themes/default/_theme.scss and in css/variables.scss.
